\title{Linear Elovich Adsorption Kinetic Model}
\usage{
elovich.lm(t, qt)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{the numerical value for contact time. This parameter should not be equal to zero to prevent infinite value. Any row(s) that contain(s) value of t equal to zero will be automatically removed to proceed with the calculation.}

\item{qt}{the numerical value for the amount adsorbed at time t}
}
\value{
the linear regression and the parameter estimation for the Elovich Adsorption Kinetic Model
}
\description{
The Elovich Adsorption Kinetic Model is an empirical rate equation that states the adsorption energy rises in a linear relationship with surface coverage. The model assumes that adsorption occurs on localized sites, the interaction between adsorbed ions is present, and the concentration of adsorbate is considered to be constant. It is applicable in gas adsorptions as well as wastewater processes (Largitte and Pasquier, 2016).
